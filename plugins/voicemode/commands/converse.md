# /voicemode:converse

Start an ongoing voice conversation with the user using the `voicemode:converse` MCP tool.

## Implementation

Use the `voicemode:converse` tool with the user's message. All parameters have sensible defaults.

If the tool call fails or you need more information about voice capabilities, load the `voicemode` skill for complete documentation.
