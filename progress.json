Dogfooding (tel-009): updated collector to use conversation logs for accurate multi-exchange tracking (761 conversations, 19,081 exchanges), added provider name normalization, verified privacy binning, sent real telemetry to production endpoint. Documentation (tel-010): added comprehensive Telemetry and Privacy section to docs/reference/environment.md covering config, opt-out methods, data collection, and privacy protections."

Key deliverables: telemetry module (voice_mode/telemetry/), config integration (VOICEMODE_TELEMETRY, DO_NOT_TRACK), opt-in UX (CLI prompts, MCP tools/resources). Research confirmed Cloudflare Workers for backend. Remaining: tel-008 (backend), tel-009 (dogfood), tel-010 (docs). Harness pattern working well with Task tool spawning workers.",

Improved collector to use conversation logs for accurate session tracking. Added privacy documentation. All 10/10 features now passing. Telemetry system is production-ready with endpoint at https://voicemode-telemetry.late-limit-5e4c.workers.dev/telemetry."
